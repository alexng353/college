In mathematics, a binary operation (like addition or multiplication) is said to be **commutative** if the order in which the operands are applied does not change the result. In other words, for an operation `*` to be commutative, the following must hold for all values of \(a\) and \(b\):

$$
a * b = b * a
$$

### Example:
- **Addition** is commutative because \( a + b = b + a \) for any numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
- **Multiplication** is also commutative because \( a \times b = b \times a \).

However, **subtraction** and **division** are **not** commutative, as \( a - b \neq b - a \) and \( a / b \neq b / a \) in general.

In proofs, this property is often used to simplify expressions or to justify rearranging terms in equations.
