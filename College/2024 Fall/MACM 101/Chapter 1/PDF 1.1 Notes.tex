\section{Definitions}


\subsection{Deduction/Deductive Logic}

Deduction is the process of deriving a conclusion from a given set of axioms 
or premises. In Logic, we start from the ground (axioms) and work our way up to
the conclusion.

\subsection{Truth Value}

A truth value can be either true or false, but not both. This comes from the
\textit{principium tertii eclusi} of Aristotle.

\subsubsection{True and False}

We will use 0 and 1 to denote true and false, respectively.

\subsubsection{Unknown Truth Value}

The proposition $u$ is \textit{unknown truth value}.

\subsection{Proposition}

A proposition is a declarative sentence (or statement) that possesses truth value.

\subsubsection{Notation}

Lowercase letters denote primitive propositions, and uppercase letters denote
complex propositions.

Primitive propositions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Propositions that cannot be decomposed into anything simpler
\item $p: 3 + 5 = 8$
\item $q: \text{It is raining}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples of things that are not propositions}

\begin{itemize}
\item $p:$ Sit down! $\to$ not a proposition because it is not a declarative
\item $q:$ The statement you are reading is now false. $\to$ not a proposition
  because it is a contradiction.
\item $r:$ The number $x$ is an integer. $\to$ not a proposition because it 
  contains an unspecified variable, which means it's truth value cannot be
  definitively determined without additional information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Syntactics and Semantics}

Syntatic reasoning is what can be shown. 

Syntax ~= grammar (rules of sentance construction), the structure of propositions

Semantics reasoning is what is true

Semantics ~= meaning (truth value), the truth value/tables of propositions

\subsection{Literals}

A \textit{literal} is either a primitive proposition or its negation (some
textbooks use ~ to denote a literal)

\section{Operator Syntax}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Negation - $\neg$ \\
    $q:$ it is raining, $\neg q:$ it is not raining\\
  Everything in this list other than $\neg $  is known as a \textit{logical connective}
  \item Conjunction - $\land$ - Logical and\\
    $p \land q:$ it is raining and it is sunny \\
    $p \land \neg q:$ it is raining and it is not sunny
  \item Disjunction - $\lor$ - Inclusive Or\\
    $p \lor q:$ it is raining or it is sunny \\
    $p \lor \neg q:$ it is raining or it is not sunny
  \item Disjunction - $\oplus$ - Exclusive Or\\
    $p \oplus q:$ it is raining xor it is sunny \\
    $p \oplus \neg q:$ it is raining xor it is not sunny\\
    XOR is generally what is meant in english s\entences like "the meal comes
    with either soup or salad"
  \item Implication - $\to$ - "If, then"
  \item Biconditional - $\leftrightarrow$ - "If and only if"
\end{enumerate}

Nobody knows why OR and XOR are both called Disjunction

All propositions formed with logical connectives are called \textit{compound propositions},
as opposed to \textit{primitive propositions}

Compound propositions need not have causal
relations between atomic components (they
can sound nonsensical and still be valid) â€“
material implication as opposed to causal
implication, which lacks temporal ordering. (straight from the slides, p. 34)

\section{Semantics}

TRUTH TABLES. that's basically all semantics is
