Prove that $xor \equiv (\iff)$

exercise for the reader

\section{Review (Propositional Identities)}

\begin{equation}
  p \lor (q \land r) \equiv (p \lor q) \land (p \lor r)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  p \land (q \lor r) \equiv (p \land q) \lor (p \land r)
\end{equation}

\caption{These two identities are known as the \textbf{Distributive Laws}}

They come in a pair because of "Duality" (Research me)

*Memorize all of the identities from C1.1 Lecture Slides p.90

\subsection{Prove that XOR is Equivalent to IFF}

$\dots$

\section{Logical Implication and Valid Arguments}

if $p \implies q$ and $q \implies p$, then $p \biconditional q$

*No logic puzzles on the exam

\section{Normal Forms}

A system in which expressions of a formal language can be transformed according
to a finite set of *rewrite rules* is called a reduction system.

In Mathematics, computer science and logic, rewriting covers a wide range of
methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other tierms.

In abstract rewriting, an object is in 

\subsection{CNF and DNF}

Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) is a conjunction of one or more clauses, where
a clause is a disjunction of literals. It is an AND of ORs.

Stated formally, if $A, \to$ is an abstract writing system, some $x \in A$ is
in normal form if no $y \in A$ exists such that $x \to y$.

Example:

\begin{equation}
(a \land \neg b) \lor c
\end{equation}

*Define "vacuously true" and "trivially true" (proofs ???)
