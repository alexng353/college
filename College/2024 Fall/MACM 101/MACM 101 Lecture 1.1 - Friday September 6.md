There is a very simple Logical problem on the final exam

Everything we do in 101 is deduction

A proposition is a **declarative** statement with **truthiness**

You cannot have something that is simultaneously true and false -> avoid contradictions

Lowercase letters denote primitive propositions, Uppercase letters denote complex propositions

Self referentially is bad

**If you cannot take a proposition and negate it, it is not a valid proposition**

Insert a logical constant, or quantifying the statement (C2)

$u$ -> uncertain

# Operators
The term *literal* is either a primitive proposition or its negation (some textbooks use ~)
1. Negation - $\neg$
2. Conjunction - $\land$ - Logical and
3. Disjunction - $\lor$ - Inclusive Or
4. Disjunction - $\oplus$ - Exclusive Or
5. Implication - $\rightarrow$ -
