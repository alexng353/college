Discrete mathematics is concerned with discrete mathematical structures instead of continuous ones (Integers).

> Integers are the cornerstone of discrete mathematics

- Discrete Mathematics models real-world phenomena that vary between discrete states.
- It is the formal basis for computing science since **computers are finite state machines**
- This course will be the formal foundation for everything we learn in computing science
- Proof Theory within Discrete Mathematics
- The Fibonacci sequence (??)
- "You should have done that in highschool"
- Chinese Remainder Theorem
- No Algorithms
- Older revisions of the textbook have the same Chapter Order
- Heuristics (???)
- Study Chapter 4 extremely hard
- There's a question on the final exam about inclusion and exclusion 
	- He will give us the problem before the final
- What is function? -> Shin Reference
## Study The Algebraic Axioms
The commutative principle: $a = b, b=a$

# Proofs
The worst thing to do with proofs is to use an example

Use the axioms of whatever system you are in to determine the proofs

$p$ implies $q$: $p \rightarrow q$
If (0=1), then (1=1)
1. (0=1), given premise
2. (1=0), commutative law
3. (1=1), addition of previous two statements **???**

"QED"
