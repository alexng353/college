[[CMPT 105w - Communications]]
[[CMPT 125 - Intro to CS & Programming II]]
[[MACM 101 - Discrete Math I]]
[[MATH 240 - Linear Algebra I]]

Currently (2024-09-03) waitlisted (position 26) for MACM 101. Required course for my degree. I'm probably cooked lol

I do not regret signing up for two math courses in one semester (yet)
